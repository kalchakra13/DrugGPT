# DrugGPT
[10/2023] We release our code on the pre-processing and generation of data and model. However, our university is patenting some of the algorithm but we are working very hard to make everything avaliable for the reviewers and stay transparent. We are waiting to hear back but promise we will make all the codebase avaliable in the coming weeks!

If you encounter any problems when using the code, or want to report a bug, you can open an issue or email hongjian.zhou@cs.ox.ac.uk and fenglin.liu@eng.ox.ac.uk. Please try to specify the problem with details so we can help you better and quicker!
